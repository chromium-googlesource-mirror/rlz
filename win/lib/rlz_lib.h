// A library to manage RLZ information for access-points shared
// across different client applications.
//
// All functions return true on success and false on error.
// This implemenation is thread safe.
//
// Each prototype mentions the registry access requirements:
//
// HKLM read:  Will work from any process and at any privilege level on Vista.
// HKCU read:  Calls made from the SYSTEM account must pass the current user's
//             SID as the optional 'sid' param. Can be called from low integrity
//             process on Vista.
// HKCU write: Calls made from the SYSTEM account must pass the current user's
//             SID as the optional 'sid' param. Calls require at least medium
//             integrity on Vista (e.g. Toolbar will need to use their broker)
// HKLM write: Calls must be made from an account with admin rights. No SID
//             need be passed when running as SYSTEM.
// Functions which do not access registry will be marked with "no restrictions".
